== Upgrading ==

=== from v0.97b or Git Repo ===

The following should be enough:

{{{

$ easy_install cds-indico

$ indico_initial_setup --existing-config=/opt/indico/etc/indico.conf #replace with your path to your indico.conf

# restart apache
/path/to/httpd restart

}}}

The following command will also be required, if you're upgrading from v0.97b or an old Git version:

{{{
python -c "from MaKaC.common.db import DBMgr; \
DBMgr.getInstance().startRequest(); from MaKaC.modules.base import ModulesHolder; \
del ModulesHolder()._getIdx()['upcoming_events']; DBMgr.getInstance().endRequest()"
}}}

''This will cause the configuration of your '''upcoming events''' list to be reset, so, if you had one set (if you don't know what it is, you probably haven't), you'll have to reconfigure it''.

Finally, when you first open Indico, you should immediately go to the administration page, then `Plugins` and click `Reload All Manually`. This will take into account the new plugin settings.

=== from 0.96.2 ===

Since the new version comes with more indexes, '''after installing 0.97xx''' you will have to run the
scripts:

{{{
/indico_home_directory/bin/maintenance/indexes/reindexcategorynameindex.py
/indico_home_directory/bin/maintenance/indexes/reindexcategorydateindex.py
}}}

=== from older versions ===

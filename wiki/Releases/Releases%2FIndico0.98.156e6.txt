If you need a detailed installation process, please read [wiki:Admin/Installation0.98 here].

== `easy_install` ==

{{{
easy_install indico
}}}

Please note that the package has been renamed from `cds-indico` to `indico`. **Make sure you delete the old `.egg` file before installing**.

== Download ==

If you prefer to download the egg or tarball to install manually:

 * [[http://indico-software.org/download/indico/indico-0.98.1-py2.7.egg|Egg]] for Python 2.7
 * [[http://indico-software.org/download/indico/indico-0.98.1-py2.6.egg|Egg]] for Python 2.6
 * [[http://indico-software.org/download/indico/indico-0.98.1.tar.gz|Tarball]]

== Upgrading ==

=== from 0.97.x/0.98 ===

{{{
python /path/to/indico/bin/migration/migrate_0.97_0.98.py --prev-version=<version>
}}}

Replacing `<version>` by the version you are upgrading from (e.g. `0.97`).

If you are using the Room Booking module, you should add the `--with-rb` parameter;

If you are upgrading from 0.97b, you should also follow the section "[[http://indico-software.org/wiki/Releases/Indico0.97.1#fromv0.97borGitRepo|from v0.97b or Git Repo]]".

=== from 0.96.2 ===

Since the new version comes with more indexes, '''after installing 0.97xx''' you will have to run the
scripts:

{{{
/indico_home_directory/bin/maintenance/indexes/reindexcategorynameindex.py
/indico_home_directory/bin/maintenance/indexes/reindexcategorydateindex.py
}}}

(then proceed as if you were coming from 0.97.x)

=== from older versions ===

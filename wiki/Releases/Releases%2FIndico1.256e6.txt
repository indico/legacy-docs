== Installing ==

Simply run:

{{{
easy_install indico
}}}

If you are upgrading from 0.97, please note that the package has been renamed from `cds-indico` to `indico`. **Make sure you delete the old `.egg` file before installing**.


If you prefer to download the egg or tarball to install manually:

 * [[http://indico-software.org/download/indico/indico-1.2-py2.7.egg|Egg]] for Python 2.7
 * [[http://indico-software.org/download/indico/indico-1.2-py2.6.egg|Egg]] for Python 2.6
 * [[http://indico-software.org/download/indico/indico-1.2.tar.gz|Tarball]]

== Migrating ==

=== from 0.97.2 - 1.1.x ===

{{{
$ indico_initial_setup --existing-config=/opt/indico/etc/indico.conf
$ python /path/to/indico/bin/migration/migrate.py --prev-version=<version>
}}}

Replacing `<version>` by the version you are upgrading from (e.g. `1.1`).

If you are using the Room Booking module, you should add the `--with-rb` parameter to `indico_initial_setup`;


=== from older versions ===

In this case you must go to the [[wiki:Download|Downloads]] page and click on the version that follows yours. Install it and follow the migration instructions. Then proceed with the next version, and so forth, until you reach 0.97. 
Once you have done it to 0.97 you can proceed as explained in the previous section ''from 0.97.x/0.98/0.99/1.0''.

A detailed explanation on how to migrate from 0.94 to 0.99 can be found [[wiki:Admin/install/from0.94|here]].

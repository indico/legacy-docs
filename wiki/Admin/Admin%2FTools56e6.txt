== Indico Shell ==

If for any reason you need direct access to the Indico DB, or to manually run some task, etc... indicoShell may be of your interest.
indicoShell is a simple [http://ipython.scipy.org/ IPython]-based environment that automatically sets up some basic structures that will help you in your management tasks.

==== Installing ====
==== < v0.97 ====

If for some reason you are using an older version of Indico, you can always download the required files from our [wiki:Download#Gitsources Git repo], or simply through our web interface:
 * [source:indico/bin/utils/indicoShell.py@v0.97-series]
 * [source:indico/bin/utils/indicoShell.sh@v0.97-series]

==== v0.97+ ====
indicoShell is part of the Indico distribution for all the v0.97-series releases. It's located inside `bin/utils`. You should adapt `indicoShell.sh` (or `indicoShell.bat` under Windows) to suit your Indico environment (set the `INDICOPATH` environment variable, or just ignore it if Indico is already installed in your system-wide python package directory).

==== v0.98 ====

From 0.98 on, the Indico Shell is available from the binary path of any server that has Indico installed:

{{{
jdoe ~$ indico_shell
}}}


IPython is required (you can simply easy_install/pip it). Windows users will also need to install [http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/PyReadline/Intro PyReadline].

==== Example
It should be very straightforward to use indicoShell:
{{{
#!python
In [1]: AvatarHolder().getById(22116)
Out[1]: <MaKaC.user.Avatar object at 0xb6f2822c>

In [2]: AvatarHolder().getById(22116).getFullName()
Out[2]: 'FERREIRA, Jose Pedro'

In [3]: a = AvatarHolder().getById(22116) 

In [4]: a.setSurName('Doe')

In [5]: a.getFullName() 
Out[5]: 'DOE, Jose Pedro'
}}}

Erasing an user and commiting changes to DB:
{{{
#!python
In [1]: AvatarHolder().getById(0)
Out[1]: <MaKaC.user.Avatar object at 0xb6f2822c>

In [2]: a = AvatarHolder().getById(0) 

In [3]: AvatarHolder().remove(a)

In [4]: dbi.commit()
}}}

Erasing the DB:
{{{
#!python
In [1]: a = dbi.getDBConnection().root()

In [2]: a.clear()

In [3]: dbi.commit()
}}}

A hands-on example for DB-exploration has been given [https://indico.cern.ch/contributionDisplay.py?sessionId=3&contribId=29&confId=235520 in the 1st InDiCo workshop].

= Check-in App =

From version 1.2, Indico allows you to create digital conference tickets containing a [[wikipedia:QR_Code|QR code]].

This allows you to easily track attendants by scanning their **e-ticket**.

To use this feature, simply enable the **e-tickets module** in the conference's **registration form** settings.

Right after that, you will be shown a QR code which you need to use to **link** the **conference** with the **check-in app**.[[BR]]
To do so, press the **Add event** button in the app and scan the QR code that is in your screen. You will be redirected to Indico's[[BR]]
login page; simply enter your Indico credentials.

To check a user in, press **Check in** and scan the QR code on the attendant's ticket. After scanning it you will be[[BR]]
shown information about the attendant and can mark him as checked-in (or check him back out).[[BR]]
You can also view a list of checked-in attendants.

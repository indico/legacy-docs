= Version numbering =

There's a difference between version numbering '''in the source code''' (`MaKaC/__init__.py`) and '''in Git''' (branch name, tag, etc...):

== Git ==

 * We usually work on a `v[number]-series` branch (i.e. `v0.97-series`);
 * Occasionally, we create tags for specific releases (i.e. `v0.97b` and `v0.97b2`)
 * For parallel development (i.e. `v0.97-series` against `v0.98-series`) we branch out and periodically merge;

== Source code ==

 * We usually keep the version number of the last release (except for new branches, that deserve a `dev` prefix, i.e. `v0.98-dev`);

= My Indico: My Profile =
'''My Indico''' pretends to bring more relevant information about the interactions of a user in Indico to his '''My Profile''' area. As for now, this area contains the following tabs:

* [wiki:Dev/Technical/DashboardContents Dashboard]
* Account Details
* Preferences
* Favorites
* HTTP Api

From these, the '''Dashboard''' tab is the one paving the road towards My Indico, providing a summary of events that are relevant to the user. The rest are expected to suffer changes as well in order to improve the relevance of the information given.

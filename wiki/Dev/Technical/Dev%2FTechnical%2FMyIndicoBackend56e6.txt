= My Indico: Backend =

Currently, the backend of '''My Indico''' is essentially the {{{linkedTo}}} dictionary within an {{{Avatar}}} object. In order to extend the functionality of My Indico this data structure will need to go through a refactoring process. More information about the current implementation is available in the [wiki:Dev/Technical/DashboardContents Dashboard wiki page].

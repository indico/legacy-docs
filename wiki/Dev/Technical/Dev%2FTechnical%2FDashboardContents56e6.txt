= My Indico: Dashboard =
My Profile's '''Dashboard''' tab shows all relevant information to the user. This information is retrieved from the {{{linkedTo}}} dictionary within an {{{Avatar}}} object. Nested inside there are other dictionaries that refer to different areas of Indico.

In this wiki page are presented all keys that can be present. This information can be found in {{{MaKaC/user.py:Avatar.linkedToBase}}} and is expected to suffer a [wiki:Dev/Technical/MyIndicoBackend refactoring] in order to extend the functionality of '''My Indico'''.

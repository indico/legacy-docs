= Reporting Bugs =

==== By mail

When sending bug reports, please make sure you include a traceback of the error (if it's possible to get one). This can usually be obtained:

 * from the Indico log file;
 * from the web server error log file;
 * from Indico's web interface, when the "Debug" option is enabled (administration);

==== Trac Tickets

The members of the team should have the following in consideration when reporting bugs using the Trac ticketing system:

 * Use pre-formatted text whenever appropriate (i.e. tracebacks);
 * Make sure tracebacks, etc. don't include sensitive information (passwords, modification keys '''and even session cookies''');

'''Title:''' ''Replacing the Templating Engine''

'''Author:''' Pedro Ferreira

'''Date:''' 06 Nov 2009

'''Target version:''' [milestone:v0.98] (?)

'''Status:''' implemented


=== Objectives ===

 * Replacing the templating engine that we currently use, as a way of:
  * Reducing maintenance issues - there's no sense in maintaining our own thing if it's hacky and malfunctioning;
  * Improving performance;
  * Improving security;

=== Status quo ===

The current templating engine employs a mixture of two different techniques:
 * Standard Python string replacement;
 * A home-made templating language that allows `<%= ... %>` and `<% ... %>`;

Some problems are caused by this:
 * Problems with character escaping are frequent;
 * Performance is bad - no caching is done;
 * No protection mechanisms for XSS in place (on the templating side);

=== Description ===

A templating engine should include:
 * Protection against XSS;
 * Optimizations;
 * Caching;
 * Easy to parse markup (For IDEs and editors);

=== Objectives ===

 * Improve the actual proceeding functionality
 * Be able to generate proceedings in PDF and in other "editable" format.

=== Status quo ===

Right now, the manager must choose the main resource for every single contribution (heavy work) and then he can click
in the button "proceedings" to generate a ZIP file containing all the papers (sorted by ID? or session? or track?) and a Table
Of Contents with the indexes for all the papers.

=== Description ===

* Allow the generation of one single PDF.
* Allow the generation of another formats.
* Allow to customize the generated proceedings.
* Improve the "mark as main resource" process.

'''Title:''' XML output refactoring

'''Author:''' Jose Benito Gonzalez Lopez

'''Date:''' 12/04/2010

'''Target version:''' 0.98

'''Status:''' draft


=== Objectives ===

 * Get rid of the current XML output generator
 * Design a easy and extensible solution to generate XML, avoiding the cod 
repetition (for instance, when generating MarcXML).
 * "Extensible", since plugins might be adding extra information to XML outputs.

=== Status quo ===

The current output.py file is a bunch of methods with incomprehensible "if" conditions
and hard-coded stuff. Extending this output.py is rather impossible.

'''Title:''' New Namespace

'''Author:''' Pedro Ferreira

'''Date:''' 09 Feb 2010

'''Target version:''' 0.98

'''Status:''' draft


=== Objectives ===

 * To migrate from an existing `MaKaC` package to a brand-new `indico` one;
 * To reorganize once and for all the namespace;
 * Better isolating some modules, so that they can be unit tested;
 * Enforcing Python good practices;

=== Status quo ===

 * Indico is aging, no major refactoring effort done;
 * Performance is a priority, and some architectural changes will be required;
 * Naming of modules and package structure is out of date and degraded (MaKaC, no isolation between modules, etc...);
 * Some plugins (RoomBooking, epayment) are not actually plugins;
 * Unification between the "classical" interface and the new ajax-capable services is required;



=== Description ===

 * `indico`
  * `core` - core objects and functions - should be testable without db access;
   * `schema` - database objects
    * `base` - basic, general objects (Avatar, etc...)
    * `event` - event-related stuff (Conference, Session, Contribution, etc...
    * `resource` - material/resource and data storage classes (LocalFile, etc...)
   * `index` - contains `IndexManager`, and other index classes
  * `modules` - basic modules, included in Indico
   * `scheduler` - old "task daemon"
   * `news`
   * `upcoming`
   * `cssTpls`
   * ...
  * `util` - utility functions
    * `time` - time, timezone, etc...
    * `fossilize` - "fossilization"
    * `struct` - data structures
  * `db` 
   * `access` - database '''access'''
  * `web`
   * `util` - web interface utils 
    * `html` - html escaping, sanitization, etc...
   * `interface`
    * `common` - shared among interfaces (i.e. protection)
    * `form` - current WP + RH (part of it) (?)
    * `jsonrpc` - current JSONRPC services
    * `export` - data export services - common query interface, type conversion at the end (?) - ''further study required''
      * `ical` - iCal interface
      * `rss` - RSS interface
      * `atom`
      * `json`
      * `xml`
   * `wsgi` - WSGI handlers, etc
   * `tpl` - template files
  * `ext` - base namespace for extensions (plugins)
   * `base`- base classes for plugins
   * `livesync`

==== Further improvements ====
 * Plugins should be isolated as individual packages (EGGs, RPMs, etc...) instead of being moved to the source tree;

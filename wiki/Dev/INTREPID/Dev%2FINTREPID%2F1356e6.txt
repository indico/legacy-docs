'''Title:''' CSS extension and Client-side templates

'''Author:''' Pedro Ferreira

'''Date:''' 15/05/2013

'''Target version:''' 1.2

'''Status:''' ''draft''


=== Objectives ===

 * Introduce a language that is more powerful than CSS, thus allowing us to better organize new stylesheet information and reduce the amount of replicated code;
 * Introduce a client-side templating language, as a way of letting people create dynamic client-side interfaces with no need for "pre-generated" hidden HTML code and/or ugly giant jQuery "pseudo-template" chains; 

=== Status quo ===

Stylesheet-wise, we are using plain CSS, most of which is concentrated in `Default.css`. With the introduction of a new CSS file structure (`core.css`, `buttons.css`, et al...), it would be nice to make sure this code remains organized and in the most modular structure possible.
CSS poses a series of problems:

 * It lacks inheritance features, thus making it harder (or practically impossible) to re-use code
 * It lacks variables and other constructs, hence making it impossible to set global style parameters without having to employ a lot of automatic or even manual replacement work

Client-side templates are currently provided by underscore.js, but these are very primitive. underscore's templatinb language is extremely limited.

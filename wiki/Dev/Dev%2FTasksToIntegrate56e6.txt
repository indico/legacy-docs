== How to use it ==
Please follow this trac wiki format:
{{{
  * ticket_number [http://link_to_user_repo user_name] branch_name
}}}
Use a ! before the # if your branch name has a #. For instance:
{{{
  * #146 [http://cdsware.cern.ch/repo/?p=personal/cds-indico-dmartinc.git;a=summary dmartinc] fix!#146-something-funny
}}}
becomes:
  * #146 [http://cdsware.cern.ch/repo/?p=personal/cds-indico-dmartinc.git;a=summary dmartinc] fix!#146-something-funny

Finally, if you have several branches to integrate, write the most urgent ones first.


== Pending list ==
  * #395 [http://cdsware.cern.ch/repo/?p=personal/cds-indico-lsyroka.git;a=summary lsyroka] fix!#395-sanity-module ''Fixes also #389 and #376. Very sensitive. Need to be tested properly.''
